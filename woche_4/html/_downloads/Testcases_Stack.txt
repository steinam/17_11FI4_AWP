Final Testcases for Stack-Implementation
========================================

1  Create a Stack and verify that IsEmpty is true.

2  Push a single object on the Stack and verify that IsEmpty is false.

3  Push a single object, Pop the object, and verify that IsEmpty is true.

4  Push a single object, remembering what it is; Pop the object, and verify that the 
   two objects are equal.

5  Push three objects, remembering what they are; Pop each one, and verify that 
   they are removed in the correct order.

6  Pop a Stack that has no elements.

7  Push a single object and then call Top. Verify that IsEmpty is false.

8  Push a single object, remembering what it is; and then call Top. Verify that the 
   object that is returned is the same as the one that was pushed.

9  Call Top on a Stack with no elements.
